<h2>About Me!</h2>

<p>
Nice to meet you! My name is Taylor Clark, and I am a Senior (graduating May 2025 - very soon!) in the
<a href="https://www.fordham.edu/fordham-college-at-lincoln-center/honors-programs-societies-and-awards/honors-program/">Lincoln Center Honors Program</a>
 at Fordham University. I am majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Cybersecurity and French; I have a passion for languages of all types! I am also 
in the accelerated masters program at Fordham University studying Data Science (graduating May 2026).
I am passionate about machine learning, software engineering, and data science and would like to pursue a career where my creativity can shine 
creating innovative solutions!
</p>

<p>
I have experience coding in Python, C++, Java, JavaScript, SQL, and HTML. I also am proficient in using the libraries Matplotlib, 
Numpy, Pandas, Scikit Learn, TensorFlow, and XGBoost.
</p>

<p>
This past summer, I conducted research in machine learning for network attack detection (read more <a href="https://taylor-clark6.github.io/Taylor-Clark/2024/10/30/Machine-Learning-Based-Detection-for-Cyber-Attacks-in-Internet-of-Medical-Things-Devices.html">here</a>!)
</p>

<p>
I am eager to expand my knowledge and experience in technology and engineering! Please
do not hesitate to <a href="mailto:tclark38@fordham.edu">contact me</a> at any time with inquiries or requests!
