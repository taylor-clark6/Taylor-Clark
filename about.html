<h2>About Me!</h2>

<p>
Nice to meet you! My name is Taylor Clark, and I am a MS in Data Science candidate at Fordham University (graduating May 2026)! I recently graduated Summa Cum 
Laude and Phi Beta Kappa from Fordham University in the
<a href="https://www.fordham.edu/fordham-college-at-lincoln-center/honors-programs-societies-and-awards/honors-program/">Lincoln Center Honors Program</a>
with a BS in Computer Science and minors in Cybersecurity and French.
I am passionate about machine learning, software engineering, and data science and would like to pursue a career where my creativity can shine 
creating innovative solutions!
</p>

<p>
I have experience coding in Python, C++, Java, JavaScript, SQL, and HTML. I also am proficient in using the libraries Matplotlib, 
Numpy, Pandas, Scikit Learn, TensorFlow, and XGBoost.
</p>

<p>
This past summer, I conducted research in machine learning for network attack detection (read more <a href="https://taylor-clark6.github.io/Taylor-Clark/2024/10/30/Machine-Learning-Based-Detection-for-Cyber-Attacks-in-Internet-of-Medical-Things-Devices.html">here</a>!)
</p>

<p>
I am eager to expand my knowledge and experience in technology and engineering! Please
do not hesitate to <a href="mailto:tclark38@fordham.edu">contact me</a> at any time with inquiries or requests!
