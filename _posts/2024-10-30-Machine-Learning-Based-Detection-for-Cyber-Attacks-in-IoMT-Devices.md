  <p>My mmachine learning skills continue to grow! During summer 2024, I researched machine learning based detection 
    for cyber attacks in IoMT devices. I noticed a problem in the healthcare industry, the vulnerability of IoMT devices 
    to cyber attacks and the devastating consequences of such attacks, and I sought to use technology to solve it. I 
    developed the project in Jupyter Notebook using Python and libraries such as Matplotlib, Numpy, Pandas, and Scikit 
    Learn. I learned a lot about how different machine learning models work and which cases they are best suited for, 
    from Isolation Forests to Neural Networks, and my greatest success was training a Decision Tree model to detect ARP 
    Spoofing attacks on Wifi and MQTT IoMT devices, which was 97% accurate in its detection. I presented my research at 
    the IEEE MIT Undergraduate Research Technology Conference (URTC) in October, and my research paper will be published 
    in the IEEE Digital Xplore Library this year. I am also a finalist for the <a href="https://www.aspirations.org/people/taylor-c/148030">National 
    Center for Women & Information Technology (NCWIT) Aspirations in Computing Collegiate Award!</a></p>
